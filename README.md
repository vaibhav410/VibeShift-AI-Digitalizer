VibeShift is an AI-powered autonomous decision engine that instantly converts simple documents or images (like restaurant menus or product catalogs) into fully functional ordering applications — without writing a single line of code.

🧠 Example: Autonomous Ordering App Generation

VibeShift’s Autonomous Decision Engine analyzes the uploaded document and automatically generates the correct application structure.

📥 Step 1: Input Document (The Menu)

Upload a simple image of a menu or product catalog.

Example Input (Restaurant Menu Image):

<div align="center"> <img width="900" alt="Sample Restaurant Menu" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0712668e-f8f9-4fe5-b5c8-4f75ed0d4bfd" /> </div>
⚙️ Step 2: VibeShift Result (Live Ordering App)

The system automatically detects the E-commerce / Ordering intent and deploys a full-fledged ordering portal where users can place orders instantly.

✨ What gets generated automatically:

Selectable food items

Quantity options (Quarter / Half / Full)

Live shopping cart

Clean & mobile-friendly UI

Generated Ordering App Preview:

<div align="center"> <img width="650" alt="Generated Ordering App" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef150320-f3b9-47ca-8a7d-aa17365aea01" /> </div>
🚫 No Coding Required

Everything is structured automatically — from menu parsing to cart generation — making it ideal for colleges, local communities, and small businesses.
