VibeShift’s Autonomous Decision Engine instantly analyzes the intent of campus documents such as feedback forms, registration forms, surveys, and menus, and automatically generates the correct online application structure.

This solves a common campus problem where forms are still paper-based or static PDFs, leading to manual work and slow data processing.

Step 1: Input Document (Campus Form / Feedback / Registration)

Upload a simple image or PDF of a campus document such as:

Event registration form

Student feedback form

Club membership form

Mess feedback or menu

<div align="center"> <img width="400" alt="Sample Campus Form" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42395f64-9901-4a66-8ef1-dd074f50b36e"> </div>
Step 2: VibeShift Result (Live Online System)

The system automatically detects the form intent (registration, feedback, survey, ordering, etc.) and deploys a fully functional online web application where users can submit responses instantly.
