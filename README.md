VibeShift’s Autonomous Decision Engine instantly analyzes the intent of campus documents such as feedback forms, registration forms, surveys, and menus, and automatically generates the correct online application structure.

This solves a common campus problem where forms are still paper-based or static PDFs, leading to manual work and slow data processing.

Step 1: Input Document (Campus Form / Feedback / Registration)

Upload a simple image or PDF of a campus document such as:

Event registration form

Student feedback form

Club membership form

Mess feedback or menu

<div align="center"> <img width="400" alt="Sample Campus Form" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42395f64-9901-4a66-8ef1-dd074f50b36e"> </div>
Step 2: VibeShift Result (Live Online System)

The system automatically detects the form intent (registration, feedback, survey, ordering, etc.) and deploys a fully functional online web application where users can submit responses instantly.

No Coding Required
The application is automatically structured with:

Input fields

Validation

Real-time data collection

Ready-to-use backend

🧠 WHY THIS WORKS FOR TECHSPRINT

✅ Real campus problem (forms & feedback chaos)

✅ Google technology used in core logic

✅ Working prototype

✅ Clear, measurable impact

Judge ab ye nahi sochega “ye general startup hai”
Judge sochega:

“Ye solution humare campus me bhi kaam aa sakta hai.”

🔥 Ab final kaam (last step)

Agar tu bole:

“Full README final bana de”

“PPT slides ka content de”

“Portal submission description likh de”

main 5–10 min me final submission-ready bana dunga 💪

Bilkul bhai 👍
Neeche TechSprint-ready, professional GitHub README de raha hoon — campus-focused, judge-friendly, aur clean startup tone ke saath.
Tu isse direct copy-paste kar sakta hai.
(Image links wahi use kiye gaye hain jo tu already use kar raha hai.)

🚀 VibeShift – AI-Powered Campus Form Digitalizer

Built with Google Gemini AI

📌 Problem Statement

In many colleges and local communities, important processes like event registrations, student feedback, surveys, and menus are still handled using paper forms or static PDFs.

This leads to:

Manual data entry

Slow processing

Human errors

No real-time insights

There is no simple system that can instantly convert these offline documents into usable online systems without manual setup or coding.

💡 Proposed Solution

VibeShift is an autonomous, multimodal AI system that uses Google Gemini AI to transform campus documents (forms, feedback sheets, menus, registrations) into fully functional web applications in seconds.

With just an image or PDF upload:

The system understands the document’s intent

Automatically generates the correct application structure

Deploys a production-ready online system

No coding. No manual configuration.

🎓 Campus & Community Use Cases

Event registration forms

Student feedback forms

Club membership forms

Mess feedback & menu digitization

Surveys for campus activities

Local canteen or shop ordering systems

This solution directly addresses real challenges faced daily in campuses and nearby communities.
